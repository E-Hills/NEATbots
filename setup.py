# TO DO:

# This file needs completion
# It should initialise the vox-craft sim directory in /neatbots
# Allowing for full functionality

# Next we need to configure the NEAT CPPNs to output in the correct format for our simulation
# (By recording features such as no. of voxels, no. of materials and so on)

# Hardest current tasks are the ability of passing signals to the robot during simulation runtime
# and the ability to actuate voxels independently.
# Both of which may require us to modify the code of voxelyse
# Thankfully, we already have a fork of voxcraft-sim, and we have configured our linux environment to run CUDA tasks
# although we may need to re-install the Linux CUDA toolkit.
